"""10-10. Common Words: Visit Project Gutenberg (http://gutenberg.org/ )
and find a few texts you’d like to analyze. Download the text files for these
works, or copy the raw text from your browser into a text file on your
computer.
You can use the count() method to find out how many times a word or
phrase appears in a string. For example, the following code counts the number
of times 'row' appears in a string:
>>> line = "Row, row, row your boat"
>>> line.count('row')
2
>>> line.lower().count('row')
3
Notice that converting the string to lowercase using lower() catches
all appearances of the word you’re looking for, regardless of how it’s
formatted.
Write a program that reads the files you found at Project Gutenberg and
determines how many times the word 'the' appears in each text."""
